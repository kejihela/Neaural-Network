# Neural-Network
Neural Network  comprises of convolutional layers but may also include nonlinear, pooling, and fully connected layers to form a deep  neural network.
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a system of hardware and/or software modeled after the operation of neurons in the human brain in the field of information technology (IT). ANNs, also known as neural networks, are a type of deep learning technology that falls under the artificial intelligence umbrella, or AI.

What is the function of artificial neural networks?

An ANN is made up of a huge number of processors that work in parallel and are stacked in tiers. The raw input information is received by the first tier, which is equivalent to the optic neurons in human visual processing. In the same manner as neurons further away from the optic nerve receive signals from those closer to it, each succeeding tier receives the output from the layer before it, rather of the raw input. The system's output is produced by the last tier.

Neural networks and how they learn

An ANN is usually trained or fed a huge amount of data when it is first created. Training entails providing input and instructing the network on how to produce the desired output. For example, to train a network to recognize actor faces, the initial training could consist of a collection of images that include actors, non-actors, masks, statuary, and animal faces. Each input is accompanied by a corresponding identifier, such as the names of the actors or information such as "not actor" or "not human." By providing the answers, the model can learn how to execute its job better by adjusting its internal weightings.               

Types of neural networks

The depth of a neural network, or the number of layers between input and output, or the model's so-called hidden layers, is sometimes mentioned. This is why the terms neural network and deep learning are often used interchangeably. They can also be expressed in terms of the number of hidden nodes in the model or the number of inputs and outputs that each node possesses. Different variations on the traditional neural network design allow for different types of forward and backward information propagation between levels.

1. One of the most basic types of neural networks is feed-forward neural networks. They send data in one direction, passing it through multiple input nodes until it reaches the output node. Hidden node layers may or may not exist in the network, making its operation more understandable. It is set up to deal with enormous amounts of noise. In technologies like facial recognition and computer vision, this type of ANN computational model is used.

2. Recurrent Neural Networks: Complexity increases with recurrent neural networks. They save the output of processing nodes and input it back into the model as a result. The model is said to learn to anticipate the outcome of a layer in this way. Each node in the RNN model works as a memory cell, allowing calculation and operation to continue. This neural network begins with the same front propagation as a feed-forward network, but then remembers all processed data so that it can be reused in the future. During backpropagation, if the network's forecast is inaccurate, the system self-learns and continues to work toward the correct prediction. Text-to-speech conversions typically employ this form of ANN.

3. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most often utilized models nowadays. This neural network computational model employs a multilayer perceptron version and includes one or more convolutional layers that can be linked or pooled altogether. These convolutional layers produce feature maps that capture a portion of an image, which are then broken down into rectangles and sent out for nonlinear processing. The CNN model is especially popular in picture identification; it's been utilized in many of AI's most complex applications, such as facial recognition, text digitization, and natural language processing. Parameter detection, signal processing, and image categorization are some of the other applications. conversions.
