# Neural-Network
Neural Network  comprises of convolutional layers but may also include nonlinear, pooling, and fully connected layers to form a deep  neural network.
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a system of hardware and/or software modeled after the operation of neurons in the human brain in the field of information technology (IT). ANNs, also known as neural networks, are a type of deep learning technology that falls under the artificial intelligence umbrella, or AI.

What is the function of artificial neural networks?

An ANN is made up of a huge number of processors that work in parallel and are stacked in tiers. The raw input information is received by the first tier, which is equivalent to the optic neurons in human visual processing. In the same manner as neurons further away from the optic nerve receive signals from those closer to it, each succeeding tier receives the output from the layer before it, rather of the raw input. The system's output is produced by the last tier.

Neural networks and how they learn

An ANN is usually trained or fed a huge amount of data when it is first created. Training entails providing input and instructing the network on how to produce the desired output. For example, to train a network to recognize actor faces, the initial training could consist of a collection of images that include actors, non-actors, masks, statuary, and animal faces. Each input is accompanied by a corresponding identifier, such as the names of the actors or information such as "not actor" or "not human." By providing the answers, the model can learn how to execute its job better by adjusting its internal weightings.
